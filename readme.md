### This is the newfangled workflow stuffs

1. We got mo' flow
2. We got less problems

â€” Slim Shady or some such
  
### Instructions

1. Make sure you have gulp installed (NPM dat)
2. Make sure you have bower installed ("gem" dat)
3. Make sure you have skills
  - Specifically SASS
  - Jade
  - Or if not the above, the knowledge to prettify some minified/uglified HTML/CSS
4. Once you have Bower and Gulp (and preferably also yeoman, the scaffolding tool used to build all this), run "gulp watch" from the command line to serve up a livereload server. Modify Jade and Sass files directly, and Gulp will automagically compile them and update your sauce. When you want to build, run "gulp", and everything will be compacted prettily into the "dist" directory where it's totally self-contained and clutter-free. Nice, huh?
5. ...
6. Profit.
